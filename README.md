# BigInt

My biginteger realization with Boost library tests. Just a lab for my university
- [x] Boolean arithmetic
- [x] Basic arithmetic
- [x] Class with overloaded operators
- [x] Modular arithmetic
- [x] Boost Test Library
- [x] GCD (Euclid + Binary)
- [x] LCM
- [x] Interface (read/write)

## How to make

```bash
make all
```

command compiles it depending on your system architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).
Executable is `./bin/bigint`.

## How to run

Only [testing](#how-to-test) at the moment.

## How to test

To see available tests type

```bash
make available_tests
```

To test one of them just type

```bash
make test_testname
```

To see only errors (or nothing if there are no errors) type

```bash
make test_testname_errors
```

### Time tests

```bash
make test_time
./tests/bin/time 1 1000
```

Usage of `time`:
- If you execute `time` without parameters, you can see available test numbers
- First argument is the test number 
- Second argument is the number of BigIntegers to generate and operate
- Third argument is timeout in seconds (positive integer). Default is 10

### Memory leaks testing

Use valgrind. For example:

```bash
valgrind --track-origins=yes --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full ./tests/bin/time 5 1 2>err.log
```

Flag `-g` in `g++` allows you to see the line of code
in which the memory leak could be fixed.
